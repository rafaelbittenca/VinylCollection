Vinyl Collection

This website is not finalized yet. Initially this is being created to demonstrate some of my skills as a developer.
The idea is that in the future it could be a portal where lovers of vinyl records can control their collections and exchange discs.
This application is using:

C# Microsoft .NET MVC5; Entity Framework 6.0 with CodeFirst; SQLServer; 
BootStrap; Html5; CSS3; Less; JQuery; JQueryBootGrid; JavaScript; JSON; Toastr; 
Generic Repository; Unit of Work; Autofac(IoC); AutoMapper;
